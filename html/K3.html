    [Scene: The dream is over, and Po gets up to work.]
<br>    <b>-Dad</b>: Po! Get up!
<br>    Po. What are you doing up there？
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: Nothing.
<br>    Monkey! Mantis(螳螂)! Crane(鹤)! Viper(毒蛇)! Tigress!
<br>    <b>-Dad</b>: Po! Let's go! You're late for work.
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: Coming！
<br>    Sorry, dad.
<br>    <b>-Dad</b>: Sorry doesn't make the noodles.
<br>    What were you doing up there?
<br>    All that noise.
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: Nothing. I just had a crazy dream.
<br>    <b>-Dad</b>: About what?
<br>    What were you dreaming about?
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: What was I...?
<br>    I was dreaming about...
<br>    ...noodles.
<br>    <b>-Dad</b>: Noodles?
<br>    You were really dreaming about noodles?
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: Yeah. What else would I be dreaming about?
<br>    Careful! That soup is sharp.
<br>    <b>-Dad</b>: Oh, happy day!
<br>    My son finally having the noodle dream!
<br>    You don't know how long I've been waiting for this moment.
<br>    This is a sign, Po.
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: A sign of what?
<br>    You are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup.
<br>    Then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant!
<br>    As I took it over from my father who took it over from his father...
<br>    ...who won it from a friend in mahjong.
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: Dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream.
<br>    <b>-Dad</b>: No, it was the dream.
<br>    We are noodle folk.
<br>    Broth(肉汤) runs through our veins.
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: But, Dad, didn't you ever want to do something else?
<br>    Something besides noodles?
<br>    <b>-Dad</b>: Actually, when I was young and crazy,
<br>    I thought about running away and learning how to make tofu.
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: Why didn't you?
<br>    <b>-Dad</b>: Because it was a stupid dream.
<br>    Can you imagine me making tofu?
<br>    Tofu.
<br>    No! We all have our place in this world.
<br>    Mine is here,
<br>    and yours is...
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: I know, is here.
<br>    <b>-Dad</b>: No！it's at tables 2, 5, 7 and 12.
<br>    Service with a smile.
