    [Scene: Po is eating under the Peach Tree, and he meets Master Oogway, also wins encouragement from him.]
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: I see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: Is that what it is?
<br>    Sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree.
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: I understand. You eat when you are upset.
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: Upset? I'm not upset.
<br>    What makes you think I'm upset.
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: So why are you so upset?
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: I probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu.
<br>    In the history of China. In the history of sucking!
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: Probably.
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: And the Five!
<br>    Man, you should've seen them!
<br>    They totally hate me.
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: Totally.
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: How is Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior?
<br>    I mean, I'm not like the Five.
<br>    I've got no claws(爪子), no wings, no venom(毒液).
<br>    Even Mantis has those... things.
<br>    Maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles.
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: Quit, don't quit.
<br>    Noodles, don't noodles.
<br>    You are too concerned with what was and what will be.
<br>    There's a saying:
<br>    Yesterday is history,
<br>    tomorrow is a mystery,
<br>    but today is a gift.
<br>    That is why it is called the present.
