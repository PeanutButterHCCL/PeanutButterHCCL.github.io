    [Scene: in the Jade Palace, Master and his students are playing kungfu, and the bad news comes. ]
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: Well done, students...
<br>    if you were trying to disappoint me.
<br>    Tigress, you need more ferocity(凶猛)!
<br>    Monkey, greater speed.
<br>    Crane, height.
<br>    Viper, subtlety(精准). Mantis...
<br>    <b>-Zeng</b>: Master Shifu.
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: What?！
<br>    <b>-Zeng</b>: It's Master Oogway.
<br>    He wants to see you.
<br>
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: Master Oogway, you summoned me?
<br>    Is something wrong?
<br>    - Oogway: Why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend?
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: So nothing's wrong?
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: Well, I didn't say that.
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: You were saying?
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: I have had a vision.
<br>    Tai Lung will return.
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: That is impossible! He is in prison.
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: Nothing is impossible.
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: Zeng!
<br>    Fly to Chor-Ghom prison and tell them,
<br>    to double the guards, double their weapons, double everything!
<br>    Tai Lung does not leave that prison!
<br>    <b>-Zeng</b>: Yes! Master Shifu!
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: We must do something！
<br>    We can't let him march on the valley,
<br>    take his revenge！
<br>    He'll...
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: Your mind is like this water my friend.
<br>    When it is agitated it becomes difficult to see.
<br>    But if you allow it to settle...
<br>    ...the answer becomes clear.
<br>    The Dragon Scroll.
<br>    It is time.
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: But who?
<br>    Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power?
<br>    To become the Dragon Warrior?
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: I don't know.
