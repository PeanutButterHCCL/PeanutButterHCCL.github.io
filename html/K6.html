    <b>-Pig</b>: Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: Hey, Dad.
<br>    <b>-Dad</b>: Po！
<br>    Good to have you back, son.
<br>    Good to be back.
<br>    Let's go, Po.
<br>    So for our next shop it's time to face it,
<br>    the future of noodles is dice-cut vegetables(切成块的蔬菜),
<br>    no longer slices((蔬菜)丝).
<br>    Also, I was thinking, maybe this time
<br>    we'll have a kitchen you can actually stand up in.
<br>    You like that?
<br>    Po, I'm sorry if things didn't work out.
<br>    It just wasn't meant to be.
<br>    Po, forget everything else.
<br>    Your destiny still awaits.
<br>    We are noodle folk.
<br>    Broth runs deep through our veins.
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: I don't know, Dad.
<br>    Honestly, sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son.
<br>    <b>-Dad</b>: Po...
<br>    I think it's time I told you something
<br>    I should have told you a long time ago.
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: OK.
<br>    <b>-Dad</b>: The secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup.
<br>    Come here. The secret ingredient is...
<br>    nothing.
<br>    You heard me. Nothing!
<br>    There is no secret ingredient!
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: Wait, wait. It's just plain old noodle soup?
<br>    You don't add some kind of special sauce or something?
<br>    <b>-Dad</b>: Don't have to. To make something special  
<br>    you just believe it's special.
<br>    <b>-Po</b>: There is no secret ingredient.
