<br>    <b>-Master</b>: Inner peace. 
<br>    Inner peace. 
<br>    Inner... 
<br>    Would whoever is making that flapping sound quiet down?! 
<br>    Inner...
<br>    Oh, Zeng. 
<br>    Excellent. 
<br>    I could use some good news right now.
<br>
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: Master! Master!
<br>    I have... It's... It's very bad news.
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: Shifu. There is just news. There is no good or bad.
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: Master, your vision. Your vision was right.
<br>    Tai lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way.
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: That is bad news, if you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: The panda?
<br>    Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior. He wasn't meant to be here! It was an accident.
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: There are no accidents.
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: Yes, I know. You've said that already.
<br>    Twice.
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: Well. There was no accidents, either.
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: Thrice
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: My old friend. 
<br>    The panda will never fulfill his destiny, nor you yours
<br>    until you let go of the illusion of control.
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: Illusion?
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.
<br>    I cannot make it blossom when it suits me
<br>    nor make it bear fruit before its time.
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: But there are things we can control.
<br>    I can control when the fruit will fall.
<br>    And I can control where to plant the seed.
<br>    That is not illusion, Master.
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: Yes.
<br>    But no matter what you do, that seed will grow to be a peach tree.
<br>    You may wish for an apple or an orange, but you will get a peach.
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: Maybe it can.
<br>    if you are willing to guide it. To nurture it. To believe in it.
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: But how? How?
<br>    I need your help, Master
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: No, you just need to believe.
<br>    Promise me, Shifu. Promise me you will believe.
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: I will try.
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: Good. My time has come.
<br>    You must continue your journey without me.
<br>    <b>-Master</b>: What are you...? Wait!
<br>    Master! You can't leave me!
<br>    <b>-Oogway</b>: You must believe.
