<body>
    <p>At first, I want to use Chinese, but I think it is a good way to help you improve your English skills. Therefore I choose English as the primary language. <b>The best way to learn a language is undoubtedly using it in your daily life</b></p>
    <p>P.S. I can learn programming(html,javascript etc), English writing and release my stress at the same time. You don't have to worry that it may takes me too much time. </p>
